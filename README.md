# Sentiment Analysis Of Super Bowl 50 Tweets

For this particular project, I have delved into a subfield of natural language processing through a sentimental analysis of Tweets that were sent via Twitter during Super Bowl 50, which took place on February 7, 2016. In the following, I will detail my process which included collecting Tweets on a MongoDB database by utilizing Python and the Twitter API. I began this process a few hours prior to the gameâ€™s start through until the morning after the game had ended. Afterwards, I exported the data to a Pandas Dataframe whereupon I sorted through it and tweaked it for both visualization and a sentimental analysis.

The data required to run Jupyter notebooks in the Code section of this repository can be downloaded [here](https://dl.dropboxusercontent.com/u/5666137/sb50/Data.zip), which is a zip file that contains a folder with, JSON file that was exported exported from mondoDB database, process and cleaned tweets, training dataset, time stamp, geo tag. Total size of the zip file is 228 MB.
